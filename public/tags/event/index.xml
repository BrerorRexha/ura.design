      <description>During early January (7-11) Elio and Anxhelo from our team participated as mentors in the Underexposed event organized by Simply Secure in Berlin, Germany. Simply Secure
Underexposed Collective is a loosely-knit group of designers, researchers, writers, advocates, and users who reject the current trajectory of mainstream technology development. They support people by providing funding, education, mentorship, design support, research, testing, and a community for collaboration.
This was the first time Underexposed took place in the form of a residency.</description>
