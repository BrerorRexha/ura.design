      <description>Back when Ura was founded in 2016 we only had a small landing page and a Patreon to help fund the time we help Open Source projects. It was very little but the thought that people would support us kept us fueled. During that time we were also approached by I2P for helping them with updating their website and some branding. We resided to simplify the logo to something which would offer more flexibility and be already an improvement of the former logo.</description>
