      <description>HTTPS Everywhere is a free and open-source browser extension for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Brave, and Firefox for Android, which is developed collaboratively by The Tor Project and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).
It automatically makes websites use a more secure HTTPS connection instead of HTTP if they support it. HTTPS Everywhere makes it possible to block and unblock all non-HTTPS browser connections with one click.
In an effort to improve the user experience, we worked with the EFF team to reimagine HTTPS Everywhere.</description>
