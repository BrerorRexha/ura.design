      <title>Introducing Logobridge</title>

      <description>At Ura we have been constantly working with open source projects to get their branding up to speed. While we love working on fully fledged visual identities for projects, we are aware that some projects simply need a logo to get started and focus on the actual software features. This motivated us to build Logobridge, an open source collection of public domain logos anyone can use for their projects for free: https://logobridge.</description>

      <description>During early January (7-11) Elio and Anxhelo from our team participated as mentors in the Underexposed event organized by Simply Secure in Berlin, Germany. Simply Secure
Underexposed Collective is a loosely-knit group of designers, researchers, writers, advocates, and users who reject the current trajectory of mainstream technology development. They support people by providing funding, education, mentorship, design support, research, testing, and a community for collaboration.
This was the first time Underexposed took place in the form of a residency.</description>

      <title>SecureDrop Style Guide</title>

      <description>Our next project, in the series of funding from OpenTechFund, is SecureDrop. SecureDrop is an open source whistleblower submission system that media organizations can install to securely accept documents from anonymous sources.
During this process we were brought closer with the Project, getting to know the developers and designers behind it that help create a secure system for whistleblowers. The work we conducted with SecureDrop was part of the OTF Usability Lab, as have been previous ones before.</description>

      <title>I2P Style Guide and Usability Study</title>

      <description>Back when Ura was founded in 2016 we only had a small landing page and a Patreon to help fund the time we help Open Source projects. It was very little but the thought that people would support us kept us fueled. During that time we were also approached by I2P for helping them with updating their website and some branding. We resided to simplify the logo to something which would offer more flexibility and be already an improvement of the former logo.</description>

      <description>During the first weekend of November we had the pleasure to facilitate the annual Open Source Design Summit in the city we are based in, Tirana.
Open Source Design (short OSD) is a community of designers and developers pushing more open design processes and improving the user experience and interface design of open source software. The community writes articles, runs a job board, puts on events, provides resources, and presents talks targeted at developers and designers interested in working and designing in Open Source.</description>

      <title>Thunderbird Style Guide and Usability Study</title>
      <link>http://test.ura.design/blog/thunderbird-style-guide/</link>

      <description>Since early on, we had a special connection with Thunderbird. While many users moved to web-based mail clients, we always preferred using a single mail client to manage our mail and calendar. In fact, in the early days our founder Elio helped redesign the Thunderbird Conversations add-on and even now our email infrastructure is powered by ProtonMail and ProtonMail Bridge via Thunderbird.
Unfortunately, Mozilla moving away from Thunderbird created technical and design debt throughout the past years, resulting in a wider gap between Firefox and Thunderbird.</description>

      <description>Earlier this year, we announced our involvement with Open Tech Fund&amp;rsquo;s Usability Lab, providing Usability and Design Services to Internet Freedom projects. If you missed the news, head over to the announcement on our blog.
Reproducible Builds has been the first project we supported as part of the Usability Lab. Reproducible Builds represents a set of software development practices that create an independently-verifiable path from source code to the binary code used by computers.</description>
