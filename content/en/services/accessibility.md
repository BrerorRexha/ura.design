We consider accessibility a requirement and not a bonus. Getting a 100% rating on an automated accessibility checker is not enough. We provide manual and automated accessibility testing, including best practices in design and development to ensure that your project is compliant with ADA, Section 508 using WCAG 2.1 AA or higher.
